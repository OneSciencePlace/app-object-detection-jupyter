# app-object-detection-jupyter - JupyterLab behind the token gate, like every
# interactive app:
#
#   $OSP_APP_BIND:$OSP_APP_PORT     nginx gate     <- the session's only TCP listener
#   $OSP_APP_SOCK_DIR/app.sock      JupyterLab, on a Unix socket
#
# The gate checks the session token and is the authentication; Jupyter's own
# token is off and Jupyter never sees OSP_APP_TOKEN. Two processes, so the
# entrypoint stays and supervises them (web/supervise.sh): bash, not sh.
#
# This is app-jupyter's entrypoint plus two steps: the Ultralytics settings
# directory, and seeding the tutorial notebook into the session's working
# directory. Everything else is identical, on purpose -- the interactive
# contract is the same contract.

# Bulk scratch directory. The scheduler usually hands us a TMPDIR pointing at a
# host path like /scratch/$USER/job.12345 -- and Apptainer does not necessarily
# bind it. Inside the container that path may not exist and the root
# filesystem is read-only, so `mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"` would die with "Read-only
# file system". Try the candidates in order and use the first one we can
# actually write to. Under the OSP run profile the app definition sets
# TMPDIR=<job directory>/tmp, which is bound and writable. Never bind a
# scratch parent (/scratch, a Lustre root) to make an inherited TMPDIR work:
# it shows every other job directory of the account to this container.
#
# Only bulk data goes here. Secrets, sockets and session state go in
# $OSP_APP_SOCK_DIR (created by session-env.sh under the private /tmp).

# The gate is the authentication: it lets a request through only with the
# session's token (first request, in the URL) or the cookie it trades it for.
# Behind it, Jupyter's own token is off (--IdentityProvider.token=, and no
# password is set): its socket is reachable only from inside this session, the
# same as noVNC's websockify. Jupyter's XSRF protection stays on.
#
# allow_remote_access lets Jupyter accept requests whose Host header is not
# localhost -- which is every request through the Satellite proxy and the gate.
# Without it Jupyter answers them 403.
#
# allow_root is for `docker run` only. This image sets USER ospuser, so it is
# already a no-op unless somebody passes --user 0. Under Apptainer we are always
# the invoking user and the flag never applies.
#
# KernelManager.transport=ipc puts the kernel's ZMQ channels on Unix sockets
# instead of TCP. Under Docker that is cosmetic -- loopback inside the
# container's own network namespace. Under Apptainer there IS no network
# namespace, so TCP kernel ports would land on the compute node's real
# loopback, reachable by every other session on that node. The sockets are
# made in the runtime directory above, inside the 0700 session directory.
#
# trust_xheaders makes Jupyter believe the gate's X-Forwarded-Proto: https, so
# the websocket URLs it generates come out wss:// rather than ws://.
